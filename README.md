## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the `install.js` script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
node install.js
```

This script runs the command `npm install --force`, which installs the project dependencies. Please note that the `--force` flag is used to resolve any dependency conflicts. Be cautious when using this flag and make sure you understand the potential implications.

## Conclusion

This project still requires further development. One of the pending tasks is to ensure that changing the saturation only affects the zoomed part of the image. Additionally, there are other aspects that need consideration and improvement.
